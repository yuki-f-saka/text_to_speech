A Day at the Farmer’s Market
Last Saturday, I went to the farmer’s market with my sister. The market was small but busy. Many friendly farmers sold fresh fruits and vegetables. The bright apples and juicy peaches looked delicious. I greeted each seller with a smile and said, “Good morning!”
My job was to carry the shopping bag and choose good tomatoes. I felt proud when a farmer said I had a good eye. We also tried some honey. It was sweet and sticky.
Suddenly, a street musician started to play the guitar. The cheerful music made the place lively. My sister and I took a short stroll around the other stalls. We saw colorful flowers and homemade soap. They smelled wonderful.
Before leaving, we bought a loaf of bread with sunflower seeds. The baker told us it would stay fresh for days because he was meticulous about his recipe. I learned a new word, “meticulous,” which means very careful.
At home, we cooked lunch with the things we bought. The meal tasted even better because we chose the food ourselves. It was a simple morning, but I felt delighted. I want to visit the market again soon.
